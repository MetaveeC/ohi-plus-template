# How to create your OHI+ repository

This is a tailored repository for the Ocean Health Index OHI+ assessments and the OHI Toolbox. It contains templated data for 1 region. 

Please [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to tailor it for your assessment. 

Then, try the following: 

1. Open `region/calculate_scores.Rmd`. Read through and run the code with the example templated data. 
1. Read the [Toolbox Training Book](http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/) to learn how to tailor this repository for your assessment. For each data layer, you will need to not only update the filename and register it in layers.csv, but you will need to provide data for each Region in your Assessment Area on its own row. (For example, [OHI+ Baltic has 42 regions](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/blob/0842c45fe95bf7bfea9da1c99fc58acf680be0e7/baltic/layers/ao_access_gl2018.csv)). 
1. Also refer to the [OHI Manual](http://ohi-science.org/manual) and [OHI Forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum) as you have questions; they have likely been asked previously. 
1. Please also read [Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/) for guidance for tailoring your OHI+ assessment.
